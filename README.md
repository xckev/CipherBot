## Privacy Policy
We are fully committed to protecting to your privacy. 

#### Information Stored
- User ID and Guild IDs
- Public and private keys generated for each user

#### Data Usage
We use this data to encrypt/decrypt messages and to run our secure polls.

#### Distribution
We will not disclose any personal information without your consent and we do not share it with any external sites.

#### Concerns and Contact
Public and private keys are generated only if a CipherBot encryption command is used. You may send secrets through other means if you do not wish to use CipherBot. If you have any further issues, you can contact Kevin Xiao via any medium.

#### Disclaimer:
CipherBot's features are not all completely secure from cryptographic attacks. Many of the implemented cryptographic algorithms are shallow or are emulations for academic purposes. We work within the boundaries given by the Discord.py API, and cannot ensure security from threats beyond other users in your Discord server. CipherBot is not intended for professional or truly secure settings.
